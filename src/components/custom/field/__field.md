# The **field** directory

The **src/components/custom/field** directory contains the code for the custom **field** components you want to create and use with the **React SDK**.

As you run the **npm run  create** command to create new _field_ components, the generated code that you can use as a starting point for your component development will be placed in component-specific folders in **src/components/custom/field**.
