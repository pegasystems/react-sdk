# Overview

The **React SDK** combined with Pega's client orchestration APIs provides a guided iterative development workflow experience that accelerates integrating Pega’s Constellation DX API with an alternative (non-Pega) UI. Integrating an alternative design system is achieved using DX Components.

A DX component contains logic and presentation tags to merge the alternate design system with Pega’s client orchestration APIs.

The alternative design system used in the React SDK is [Material UI](https://v4.mui.com/). For more information about Constellation SDKs, see the [Constellation SDKs](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/constellation-sdks.html) documentation.

A summary of the latest updates to the **@pega/react-sdk-components** and
**@pega/react-sdk-overrides** used by the React SDK can be found in
[react-sdk-components KeyReleaseUpdates.md](./node_modules/@pega/react-sdk-components/lib/doc/KeyReleaseUpdates.md).

# Prerequisites

## Pega Infinity Server and Constellation-enabled Application

This version of the React SDK assumes that you have access to a Pega Infinity server (**24.1.0+**) running an application that is configured to run using the Constellation UI service.

The **MediaCo** sample application is already configured as a Constellation application and can be found in the React SDK download associated with this repo which is available at [https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/react-sdk](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/react-sdk). The OAuth 2.0 Client Registration records associated with the **MediaCo** application are available in the same React SDK download. For more information about the MediaCo sample application, see [MediaCo sample application](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/mediaco-sample-application.html).

The **React SDK** has been tested with:
- node 18.12.1/18.13.0
- npm 8.19.2/8.19.3 - **Note: Do not use _npm 9_**

Future updates to the SDK will support more recent LTS versions of node as Constellation supports them.

**Before** installing and running the SDK code, refer to [Downloading the Constellation SDK files](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/installing-constellation-sdks.html) for steps to prepare your Infinity server and node environment so you can proceed with the steps in the next section.
