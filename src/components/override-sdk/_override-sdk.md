# The **components/override-sdk** directory

The **src/components/override-sdk** directory contains the code for components for which you want to override the default implementation for use with the **React SDK**.

When you run the **npm run  override** command to override the default implementation of a component, the generated code that you can use as a starting point for your component development will be placed in type-specific and component-specific folders in **src/components/override-sdk**.
