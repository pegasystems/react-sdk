# The **override-sdk/template** directory

The **src/components/override-sdk/template** directory contains the code for **template** components for which you want to override the default implementation for use with the **React SDK**.

When you run the **npm run  create** command to override the default implementation of a **template** component, the generated code that you can use as a
starting point for your component development will be placed in type-specific and component-specific folders in **src/components/override-sdk/template**.
